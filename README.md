# EQ2341-Activity-Recognition
EQ2341 Activity Recognition project 2024

Requirements:
Need an editor that can run ipynb files with an python kernel.
I used vscode with Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code.
Possible to use Google Colab by uploading the project to Colab. May need to edit the data loading code from './data/training' to 'content/data/training' and './data/testing'  to 'content/data/testing', to correctly load the data.

TO run:
1. Download or clone the project
2. Run the whole EQ2341_Assignment_3.ipynb file from top to bottom, using an editor that can run ipynb files.
3. Results can be read from the outputs
